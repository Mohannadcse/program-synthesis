## Calendar Description

Topic One: Representation
- What models and intermediate representation are used to model synthesized programs? Do some forms have advantages/disadvantages over others?
- For program synthesis that is performed to meet criteria contained in a specification, How are constraints/goals modelled in the specification?
- Are there runtime models are used for program synthesis?. (e.g. virtual machines)

Topic Two: Modelling and Algorithms
- What are some formal semantic models used for programming languages?
- What algorithms are used for program synthesis?
- What types of approaches are taken to generate programs?

Topic Three: Usage
- What are some applications of program synthesis? 
- What can program synthesis accomplish that is difficult to do with standard programming?
- How can a program synthesizing system be evaluated?
- What is the state of the art?
- What are some limitations of program synthesis
- What are some potential research areas of program synthesis?

## Course Plan
| Duration | Activity | Details |
| ---- | -------- | ------- |
| Sep 03 - Oct 12 | Literature Review | Weekly meetings for presentation/discussion of papers. Students will explore existing tools for program synthesis and will execute at least one programming assignment using one or multiple tools so that they can understand the advantages and shortcomings of each tool. |
| Oct 11 | Project Proposal | 1-page written proposal + presentation to the instructor. |
| Oct 11 - Dec 5 | Tool improvements and formulation of research problems | Weekly meetings to review tool designs, specify improvements and formulate potential research problems. |
| Dec 6 | Final project presentation and report | 30 minute presentation + a written conference-style report. |
