# CMPUT 605 - Advanced Topics in Programming Languages: Program Synthesis

## Organizational Information
* Offered in: Fall 2019
* Time: ???
* Instructors: [Karim Ali](http://karimali.ca)

## Students
- Spencer Killen

## Calendar Description

Program synthesize strives to automatically create programs that satisfy a high-level, possibly incomplete, specifications. This course covers the foundations of program synthesis, including methods of program specification, SAT solvers, and program verification in addition to following methods of program synthesis:
- Inductive Synthesis (Including counterexample-guided inductive synthesis)
- Deductive Synthesis
- Superoptimization
- Program Sketching
- And Oracle-guided synthesis  

The student will review literature and study advancements in the field. The second half of the course is oriented towards creating a project which demonstrates and practicalizes the student's learnings.

## Grading

* Assignments: 20%
* Practical Experiments: 20%
* Final Report: 30%

## Course Plan
| Duration | Activity | Details |
| ---- | -------- | ------- |
| Sep 03 - Oct 12 | Literature Review | Weekly meetings for presentation/discussion of papers. Students will explore existing tools for program synthesis and will execute at least one programming assignment using one or multiple tools so that they can understand the advantages and shortcomings of each tool. |
| Oct 11 | Project Proposal | 1-page written proposal + presentation to the instructor. |
| Oct 11 - Dec 5 | Tool improvements and formulation of research problems | Weekly meetings to review tool designs, specify improvements and formulate potential research problems. |
| Dec 6 | Final project presentation and report | 30 minute presentation + a written conference-style report. |
