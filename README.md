# CMPUT 605 - Advanced Topics in Programming Languages: Program Synthesis

## Organizational Information
* Offered in: Fall 2019
* Time: ???
* Instructors: [Karim Ali](http://karimali.ca)

## Students
- Spencer Killen

## Calendar Description

Program synthesize strives to automatically create programs that satisfy a high-level, possibly incomplete, specifications. This course covers the foundations of program synthesis, including methods of program specification, SAT solvers, and program verification in addition to following methods of program synthesis:
- Inductive Synthesis (Including counterexample-guided inductive synthesis)
- Deductive Synthesis
- Superoptimization
- And Oracle-guided synthesis  

The student will review literature and study advancements in the field. The second half of the course is oriented towards creating a project which demonstrates and practicalizes the student's learnings.
